	> 1.1 **A Small CLI UI**
	

		    === Bully AE Texture Converter ===
		    1. TEX to PNG (manual)
		    2. DDS to TEX (manual)
		    3. PNG to DDS (manual)
		    4. DDS to PNG (manual)
		    5. Batch conversion
		    6. Exit
		    Choose option (1/2/3/4/5/6): -- choose for example 4
	     

> 	 As you can see, the small CLI UI is simple and easy to understand, this is because it's made for beginner friendly, i believe the **Work Smarter not Harder** sentences can lead me to a way more positive thinking, lessen the stress all the time from typos like - **`pythob Texture.py -i file.png`**   
That is why i made all this.
1.2 **Tex to Png** 
Tex to png is one of the main operation i serve in this tool, especially for Mobile Modders that doesn't have any Computers at all, in the end they're struggles to use Winlator/Exagear due to it's app of lack of responsiveness, and also they're rely on Noesis as well. In this case the Tex to png feature is available on native mobile app like pydroid.  

    Enter .tex file: --input your tex file name here

> 1.3 **Dds to Tex**  This one feature is the classic conversion for every main operation in the end after all, made by Edness just so we
> can convert a dds image to Tex file *(By injecting a dds bit masks to
> a Tex file without changing it's structure )* 

    Enter .dds file: -- input your dds file name here
    Use -c (compress zlib) flag? (y/n): -- yes or no, type y / n

> 1.4 **Png to Dds** This is a simple Conversion that gives you the ability to convert a png image to Dds before you do the Dds to Tex conversion

    Enter .png/.jpg file: -- input your png file name here

> 1.5 **Dds to Png** This one is also a simple conversion that gives you the ability to convert a dds image to Png incase this was needed. 

    Enter .dds file: -- input your dds file name here

> 1.6 **Batch Conversion** A simple small features yet powerful! by choosing the option 5, this will heading you to another UI like this

    === Batch conversion ===
    1. All TEX > PNG
    2. All PNG > DDS
    3. All DDS > TEX
    4. All DDS > PNG
    Choose batch option (1/2/3/4): -- choose for example 3


***How to use?***

> **First**, Simply extract the **`fmt_AETextureConverter.7z`** archive to an accessible directory/folder location for example: **`/storage/emulated/0/Downloads/`**  -- it should be extracted as a folder called **"AE"**  

>  Then, make it to your folder by changing your directory using the pydroid command **`cd`**
>   for example: we're currently at **`/storage/emulated/0/(Base directory)`** and this tool is at the Download folder, then you have to type a command **`cd Downloads`**  and you'll see the **`/storage/emulated/0/Downloads/`** in terminal, that means you already inside it, type **`cd AE`** to change again to the tool location, make sure it's already extracted inside **Downloads** or it will never exists, but you will see this **`/storage/emulated/0/Downloads/AE`** after done.
>after that done, By running a command **`python install.py`** for external resources
> like i've had said earlier, this one is required before you can do any
> conversions, but the good thing is, when you done installing them all,
> no cost internet connection required at all.

> **Second**, after you done installing them, you have to put all the FILES (tex, png, dds) for conversion inside the **AE** folder 

> **Third**, run the command `python cli.py` and there you have it, this!
